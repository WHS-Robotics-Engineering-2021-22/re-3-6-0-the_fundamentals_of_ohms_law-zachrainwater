# :robot: 3.6.0 - The Fundamentals of Ohm's Law

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

Ohm's Law is a fundamental rule of electronics.  Understanding how to apply it makes building your circuits, and robotics applications, more efficient and effective.  Through this lab you will apply Ohm's law in order to predict the interaction between voltage, current and resistance. üöÄ

## Circuit Setup

Import the file in this repository titled, "sample_circuit.txt" into the Circuit Simulator App.  You will use this circuit below on the "Next Steps" section.

## üíª Terms to know

- Volts
- Amps
- Ohms
- Ohm's Law
- Ohm's Law Triangle

## üìù Next steps

1. Create a markdown file titled, "results.md".
2. Complete the following steps and answer these questions in the results file (Show all calculations in your answers):
    - Hover over any point in the ciruit to get the voltage drop and current values for that part of the ciruit.  What is the total current (I<sub>T</sub>) for the circuit?
    - Calculate total resistance for the circuit (R<sub>T</sub>)?
    - Based on this answer, explain what the reistance is for the LED (R<sub>LED1</sub>)?
    - Use voltage drop for the LED to confirm your answer.  Was there a difference?  If so, why did this happen?
    - Change the model of the LED.  What changed about the R<sub>T</sub> value and voltage drop for the LED?  Explain what you think happened.
    - Generate a random number using the [Comprehensive Version on Calculator.net](https://www.calculator.net/random-number-generator.html?clower=3.5&cupper=9.5&cnums=1&cdup=y&csort=n&cnumt=d&cprec=2&ctype=2&s=52404.5677&submit1=Generate#comprehensive).  Set it as seen here:

   - Using your random number as the current in mA, given that voltage is set to 5V and choose any single LED you would like.  Adjust the resistor value until the current value  you randomly generated is achieved.  Remember to show your work on the calculations. 
3. Create a new file in this repo called "random_current.txt" which contains the exported text from the Circuit Simulator App.
